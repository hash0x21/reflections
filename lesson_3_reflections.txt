Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

since it might over write your own local files or you dont want to clutter your local with what's in your remote repo 

iDescribe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork is when you clone a repo to work on it and give credit back to the original author. clone is when you clone a repo from github to your local repo. branch is to branch off of the master branch and work on  a new feature without touching working version of the code 

iWhat is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

this way you can compare files and also work off line
